        <h2>Our Approach.</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 100px;">Ek Artha Foundation has traditionally relied on direct service delivery to assist poor and vulnerable
                groups. The well-being, social position, and rights of children and girls from marginalized communities
                
                are explicitly prioritized. <br> Ek Artha Foundation focuses on empowering women and girls to effect long-
                term equitable change. We prioritize quality education, gender equity, and long-term livelihood
                
                opportunities for all children, as well as disaster relief for earthquake victims. <br>
                Our key programming approach will continue to include social analysis and action, various value chain
                approaches for kids learning and teaching process, leadership and life skills strengthening, and capacity
                building for different children as we move forward. As a result, our approach will be to serve all
                Nepalese children who are the most difficult to reach in order to hear their voices and help them raise
                their voices.</p>
