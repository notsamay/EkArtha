        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Ek Artha Foundation, founded in 2016 AD and inspired by you to inspire the beautiful spirit, is a non-profit organization that works year-round to directly assist children and their families via various welfare initiatives on education and empowerment in rural villages.
          Education is both the means and the end to a better life: the means because it equips a person to support himself or herself and the end because it raises one's awareness of a variety of issues, including healthcare, appropriate social behavior, and understanding of one's rights, and helps him or her develop as a better citizen in the process.
          Recognizing this, the Nepalese NGO Ek Artha Foundation, which began in the corridors of education, adopted a lifecycle approach to development, focusing its interventions on children, their families, and the larger community in the future. In the beginning, we focus on educating the children. According to estimates, 3.14 million (40.4%) of Nepal's 7.7 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 work, with two-thirds of working children under the age of 14, which is likely to interfere with the child's education or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development.
          The Ek Artha Foundation was founded on the simple belief that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, that everyone has a responsibility to act, and that we all perform better when we work together. For the past two years, that premise has fueled the Foundation's efforts to overcome complex challenges and improve people's lives in Nepal.

    <div class="container hidden">
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Education for all</h2>
            <p>
                With the help of the Uniglobe Center for Social Program, Ek Artha believed that when diverse groups of people pool their resources in the spirit of genuine cooperation, transformative ideas emerge to drive life-changing action. We collaborated to inspire differently-abled people in Khagendra Navjivan Kendra, Jorpati, and Kathmandu, with the vision of Education for All. The event's highlights included an art competition, music and dance performances, and a magic show.
            </p>
            <h2>Construction of Library</h2>
            <p>With the goal of providing a place to learn outside of the classroom, we assisted the Government School of Nepal in Dolakha in establishing a library with the slogan "Library as Platform Beyond Class," which was destroyed by the earthquake. Ek Artha Foundation recognizes the importance of a library where students and staff can access a variety of resources. The school library media center's mission is to provide equitable access to books and various other learning materials for all members of the school community. This library serves as the focal point and coordinating agency for all school-related materials.</p>

            <h2>“Ek Artha” for Earthquake Victims.</h2>
            <p>
                When there is a will, there is a way, and right after the few days of earthquake, Ek Artha was able to support quake victims in various parts of the country with the help of energetic volunteers. In contrast, in a few regions, our volunteers walked for more than 4-5 hours with the help of locals to reach all unreached people and provide them with basic food, tents, and clothing. 
"Regardless of how many wrinkles we get in houses, we will stand and fight together until the mountains stop moving."
            </p>
            <h2>Support to flood victims’ students;</h2>
            <p>
                In 2074 B.S., Ek Artha extended its helping hand to the flood-ravaged southern parts of Nepal. We provided stationery and clothing to the students as a way of motivating them and demonstrating our small gesture that says “We stand together to uplift the children in any way we can.

            <h2>Sharing the happiness</h2>
            <p>
                To spread joy, Ek Artha frequently spends the holidays with the children at the orphanage. We visit the orphanage house where we cook food, assist the children with hygiene, and spend the entire day sharing dreams and participating in various creative activities. We also take the kids on dry picnics from time to time. We firmly aim to: 
                    <br>
                 • form alliances - with children and communities - to influence others and broaden our impact.  <br>
                • innovate - create and test evidence-based, replicable solutions to problems that children face  <br>
                • be the voice - advocate for better practices and policies that fulfill children's rights and ensure that children's voices are heard

            <h2>“Change 2018 “Inter College Video making competition against child labor”</h2>
            <p>
                We are all aware of the current situation, in which an estimated 225 million children are still trapped in child labor. They are denied the opportunity to be children. More than half of them, or approximately 115 million, are subjected to the most heinous forms of child labor, such as work in hazardous environments, slavery or other forms of forced labor, illicit activities such as drug trafficking and prostitution, and involvement in armed conflict. 

                We are attempting to put the values into action. Ek Artha Foundation, with the help of Success Vidhi and the Uniglobe Center for Social Programs, attempted to break the ice by organizing an event to raise public awareness about the growing trend of child labor and to assist students in receiving basic education. And to that end, we organized an inter-college video competition with panels for both undergraduate and graduate students. It was a competition to learn about the young minds' perspectives on how to end the social problems associated with child labor. 
                It improved students' social values, skills, and abilities to analyze, create, and design plans that can change people's minds. We believe that our work provided our participants with an experience that will be the deciding factor in the difference between actual actions. It acted as an initiative to establish a perfect benchmark and develop it as an event to bring different participants from various institutions and backgrounds together on a single platform to celebrate togetherness, bonding, and a friendly relationship. This event allowed our participants to collaborate with other competent individuals, expand their network, and work together for the betterment of society.

            <h2>Election 2022</h2>
            <p>
                We worked as a third eye under the direction of the Nepal Election Commission to supervise and monitor the 2022 central government election. Our volunteers were supervised in all 7 provinces of Nepal to successfully complete the central government election without any hassle or difficulties. We played role in activities like crowd management, voting booth management, and vote counting while also playing a role in securing the voting area.
