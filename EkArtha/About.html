        <p style="text-indent: 100px;" class="pa1">Ek Artha Foundation, founded in 2016 AD and inspired by you to inspire the beautiful spirit, is a non-profit organization that works year-round to directly assist children and their families via various welfare initiatives on education and empowerment in rural villages.
            <br>
            Education is both the means and the end to a better life: the means because it equips a person to support himself or herself and the end because it raises one's awareness of a variety of issues, including healthcare, appropriate social behavior, and understanding of one's rights, and helps him or her develop as a better citizen in the process.
            <br>
            Recognizing this, the Nepalese NGO Ek Artha Foundation, which began in the corridors of education, adopted a lifecycle approach to development, focusing its interventions on children, their families, and the larger community in the future. In the beginning, we focus on educating the children. According to estimates, 3.14 million (40.4%) of Nepal's 7.7 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 work, with two-thirds of working children under the age of 14, which is likely to interfere with the child's education or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development.
            <br>
            The Ek Artha Foundation was founded on the simple belief that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, that everyone has a responsibility to act, and that we all perform better when we work together. For the past two years, that premise has fueled the Foundation's efforts to overcome complex challenges and improve people's lives in Nepal.

        <p style="text-indent: 100px;" class="pa2">"Ek Artha" an NGO “inspired by you”. With the simple mission of carrying out a simple task in a simple manner that brings Artha (meaning) to our existence. The Ek Artha Foundation was founded on the simple belief that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, that everyone has a responsibility to act, and that we all perform better when we work together.
            <br> For the past two years, that premise has fueled the Foundation's efforts to overcome complex challenges and improve people's lives in Nepal. We fall in love with the innocent faces of these little angels every time, so Ek Artha Foundation is trying to make a difference in the lives of each individual. As an organization, we believe that in everyone's life, there is one single motivating factor that can change the person's entire life. So, here we try to add value to one's life and serve as a beacon pointing the way to a brighter future.
